# cpctelera-samples-Xcode

Open, edit, build & run [CPCtelera](https://github.com/lronaldo/cpctelera) samples from the comfort of Xcode

## What is this about?

CPCtelera is a library & toolchain to create games for the Amstrad family of computers. CPCtelera tries to be plattform-agnostic and currently runs on Windows, Linux & OS X. You can use whatever code editor that suits you. In my case, as Mac developer, this editor is Xcode

## Installing

Just clone this repo in the folder that contains the CPCtelera folder, so that CPCtelera & this repo are siblings. You must end with:


```
MyFolderForAmstradDevelopment
|
|--- cpctelera
|--- cpctelera_samples_xcode

```

## Using

Open cpctelera_samples.xcodeproj & hit Cmd + B (build). To clean all targets, do a clean in Xcode (Cmd + K).

You can build every example (select cpctelera_samples Scheme) or individual projects (click the Schemes menu)
